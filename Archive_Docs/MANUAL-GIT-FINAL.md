# Manual Git Commands for GCP Deployment

## Problem
Git INDEX_LOCKED state prevents automated commits. System protection requires manual terminal operations.

## Solution
Open NEW TERMINAL and run commands individually:

```bash
# 1. Add all changes
git add .

# 2. Commit with descriptive message  
git commit -m "Complete GCP hybrid deployment with CDN integration

- Automated PostgreSQL to GeoJSON export (407 restaurants)
- Google Cloud Storage CDN deployment active  
- Hybrid architecture: Database + CDN for optimal performance
- Smart deployment script with bucket auto-detection
- Environment configuration updated for production
- Full smoke testing passed with excellent response times"

# 3. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```
