# VeganMapAI - Daily Development Workflow

## ðŸŒ… Morning Startup Routine

### 1. Project Health Check (2 minutes):
```bash
npm run check     # TypeScript validation
npm run dev       # Start development server
```

### 2. Current Status Review:
- Check if site loads properly
- Test voice chat (desktop)
- Verify map clustering works
- Check any error messages

### 3. Daily Planning:
- What needs to be fixed today?
- Any user feedback to address?
- Performance issues to tackle?

### When Replit Agent Gets Stuck:
```
Hi! Replit Agent encountered an issue with [specific problem]. 

Error: [paste error message]
Location: [file and line]
What was attempted: [list solutions tried]

Can you help debug this? Should I try [proposed solution] or is there a better approach?
```

### When Planning New Features:
```
I want to add [feature description] to VeganMapAI.

This would involve:
- [list technical changes needed]
- [potential impacts on existing code]
- [estimated complexity]

Is this the right approach, or should we consider alternatives?
```

### When Performance Issues Arise:
```
I've noticed [performance issue description]:
- [specific symptoms]
- [when it occurs]
- [impact on users]

What's the best way to investigate and fix this?
```

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Debugging Protocol

### When Everything Breaks:
1. **DON'T PANIC** - Take a screenshot first
2. **STOP CODING** - Don't make it worse
3. **DOCUMENT** - What happened before the break?
4. **REVERT** - Go back to last working version if possible
5. **ASK FOR HELP** - Provide full context

### Quick Fixes to Try:
```bash
# Restart development server
Ctrl+C
npm run dev

# Clear TypeScript cache
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm run dev

# Reset database connection
npm run db:push

# Check environment variables
echo $DATABASE_URL
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
```

## ðŸ“Š Weekly Review Process

### Every Friday:
1. **Performance Check**:
   - Site speed test
   - API response times
   - Error rate review

2. **Code Quality Review**:
   - TypeScript errors
   - Console warnings
   - Unused code cleanup

3. **Planning Next Week**:
   - Priority bug fixes
   - Feature development
   - User feedback integration

## ðŸŽ® Development Tips

### Working Efficiently:
1. **Make small changes** - Test frequently
2. **One feature at a time** - Don't mix tasks
3. **Document weird fixes** - You'll forget later
4. **Screenshot errors** - Helps with debugging
5. **Backup before big changes** - Save yourself stress

### When Stuck:
1. Take a 5-minute break
2. Read the error message carefully
3. Google the exact error
4. Check if recent changes caused it
5. Ask for help with specific context

### Preventing Problems:
- Test after every change
- Keep changes small and focused
- Use TypeScript properly (no 'any')
- Follow existing code patterns
- Don't ignore warnings

## ðŸŒŸ Remember:

**You're building something amazing!** VeganMapAI has the potential to help millions of people discover great vegan food. Every small improvement matters.

**Progress > Perfection** - Better to ship something good than to perfect something that never launches.

**Ask for help early** - It's faster to get help than to struggle alone for hours.

**Document victories** - Celebrate when things work! Note what successful approaches you used.
