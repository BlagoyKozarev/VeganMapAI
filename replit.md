- **AI Chat Response Style**: Brief, clear, direct responses. No task repetition, focus on results only. Maximum 2-3 sentences per response
- **Development Approach**: Comprehensive testing before deployment, focus on real-world functionality over theoretical solutions
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed technical documentation in `replit.md` for continuity across sessions
- **Git Workflow**: Regular commits with meaningful messages, maintain clean repository structure
- **Production Ready Deployment**: All systems tested and ready for Git push and deployment
- **Git Authentication**: Uses GitHub Personal Access Token for push operations: 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

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, built with Vite.
- **UI/UX**: Custom components built on Radix UI primitives and Shadcn/ui. Styling with Tailwind CSS and CSS variables. Mobile-first responsive design with PWA functionality.
- **Maps**: Leaflet for interactive maps with `leaflet.markercluster` for clustering. Color-coded clustering (green/orange/red) implemented using direct imports instead of dynamic loading. Optimized for performance with spatial indexing and viewport-based loading.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing.
- **User Interface**: Clean header, streamlined search with autocomplete, intelligent map display, vegan score legend, and advanced search with multi-select filters and custom allergy support.

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript and Node.js (ES modules).
- **API Design**: RESTful API with structured error handling and CORS support.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, using snake_case columns. Production database contains 407 real Sofia restaurants.
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration with Express sessions and PostgreSQL store.
- **Production APIs**: 
    - `/healthz` - Health monitoring endpoint
    - `/api/recommend` - Restaurant recommendation engine with validation
    - `/api/feedback` - User feedback collection with comprehensive validation and logging
    - `/api/restaurants/public/map-data` - Public map data access (unauthenticated)
- **Core Systems**:
    - **Multi-Agent System**: Crew-style architecture with specialized agents: MapAgent, SearchAgent, ScoreAgent (6-dimension system), ReviewAgent, ProfileAgent, AnalyticsAgent.
    - **Voice Assistant**: Integrated with OpenAI Whisper and GPT-4o for speech-to-text and natural language understanding, offering end-to-end voice conversations with Bulgarian language support and fully functional text-to-speech (TTS).
    - **Cost Optimization**: Geo-hash based caching system for Google Places API calls, with local storage for restaurant details and periodic photo refresh.
    - **Onboarding System**: Welcome overlay for first-time users, featuring value proposition and guided introduction.
    - **Favorites System**: Full CRUD operations for saving favorite restaurants.
    - **Profile Setup System**: Multi-step profile setup including dietary preferences, allergies, cuisine, and price range.
