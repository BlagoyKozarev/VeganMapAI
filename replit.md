# VeganMapAI - Replit Project Guide

## Overview

VeganMapAI is a full-stack web application designed to help users discover vegan-friendly restaurants and food locations. The platform uses an intelligent multi-agent architecture to provide personalized restaurant recommendations, vegan scoring, and AI-powered chat assistance. Built with modern web technologies, it features a React frontend with TypeScript, an Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
AI Chat Response Style: Brief, clear, direct responses. No task repetition, focus on results only. Maximum 2-3 sentences per response.

## Business Planning Context (July 28, 2025)

**US Market Launch Planning:**
- Target: Top 20 US cities expansion
- Cost management priority for API expenses
- Analysis completed for scaling architecture:
  - Google Maps API: $0.10/user/month
  - AI Agent (GPT-4o): $0.12/user/month  
  - Other APIs: $0.02/user/month
  - Total: $0.24/user/month (revised from $0.17)

**Key Optimization Strategies Identified:**
- Geo-hash based caching system (-90% Place Search calls)
- Local storage for restaurant details (-95% Details calls)  
- Periodic refresh instead of real-time (-70% photo calls)
- Target cost reduction: 50-90% through intelligent caching

**Cost Analysis Update (July 29, 2025):**
- Coverage improving: Started systematic loading of missing establishments 
- Successfully added: 32 new establishments (12 cafes, 20 bakeries) with AI vegan scores
- In progress: Loading bars, takeaway, and delivery establishments
- Target: Complete 4km Sofia coverage (~514 establishments)
- Estimated costs: $10.63 one-time + $67.50/month operational (10K users)
- US expansion (20 cities): $1,880 setup + $3,375/month ($0.007/user)
- Geo-hash caching reduces operational costs by 90%
**User Request (July 29 Evening):** Remember everything - continue from this exact point tomorrow. All features working: mobile search (15 results), voice assistant (Bulgarian + error handling), complete mobile interface optimization.

**Voice Assistant Mobile Compatibility (July 30, 2025):**
- Comprehensive mobile browser detection and compatibility fixes implemented
- Enhanced error handling with browser-specific guidance and fallback messaging
- Mobile Web Speech API has limited support - added enhanced text input as primary mobile option
- Auto-retry logic for "no-speech" errors, realistic messaging for mobile limitations
- Enhanced mobile text interface with clear button, proper font sizes to prevent zoom
- System provides graceful fallback from voice to text input on mobile devices
