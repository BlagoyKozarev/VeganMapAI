# VeganMapAI Production Deployment Status

## Current Status (August 16, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Production Site LIVE
- **URL:** https://vegan-map-ai-bkozarev.replit.app/
- **Status:** Fully operational
- **Build:** Successfully deployed and serving

### ‚ùå Critical Issue: Empty Database
- **Production database:** 0 restaurants
- **Development database:** 5 restaurants  
- **Root cause:** Production uses different Neon database (ep-fragrant-glade vs ep-shiny-frog)

### üîß Solution Implemented
- Created `/api/load-sample-data` endpoint for production database initialization
- Added 5 Sofia restaurants with vegan scores (8.0, 7.8, 7.4, 7.1, 6.8)
- Endpoint includes both GET and POST methods for flexibility

### üìä Database Details
**Development DB (working):**
- 5 restaurants loaded
- Top venues: Loving Hut Sofia (8.0), Soul Kitchen (7.8), Edgy Veggy (7.4)
- All with proper coordinates and vegan scoring

**Production DB (empty):**
- Different Neon instance: ep-fragrant-glade-aeh09oio
- Needs data loading via new API endpoint
- Schema is ready and validated

### üöÄ Next Steps
1. **Deployment Update:** Waiting for Replit to deploy new code with `/api/load-sample-data` endpoint
2. **Data Loading:** Once deployed, production will automatically load Sofia restaurants
3. **Verification:** Map will show 5 restaurants with proper clustering and scoring

### üéØ Expected Result
After deployment completes:
- Production map will display 5 Sofia restaurants
- Color-coded clustering (green/orange/red) will work
- Restaurant details with vegan scores will be available
- All features (search, filtering, AI assistant) will be functional

### üìç Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** React + Vite with Leaflet maps
- **Backend:** Express + TypeScript with PostgreSQL
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL with 5 Sofia restaurants
- **Deployment:** Replit Deployments (automatic)

## Status: CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Current Situation (August 16, 2025 - 13:20)
- **Development:** ‚úÖ Working perfectly with 5 Sofia restaurants
- **Production deployment:** ‚ùå Still serving old build from 12:55:10 GMT
- **Auto-loading feature:** ‚ùå Not deployed yet (`autoLoaded: false`)

### Technical Details
- Health endpoint shows: `"restaurantCount":"0","autoLoaded":false`
- Map data endpoint returns: empty array `[]`
- Deployment system appears to have deployment lag

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Deployment needs to complete** to activate auto-loading
2. Once deployed, first `/api/health` call will trigger data loading
3. Production will automatically receive 5 Sofia restaurants

### Expected Timeline
- **Deployment update:** Waiting for Replit system
- **Data loading:** Immediate after deployment
- **Full functionality:** Within 5 minutes of deployment

## Status: MAJOR DISCOVERY - DIFFERENT DATABASES üîç

### Critical Finding (August 16, 2025 - 13:30)
**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:** Development and Production use completely separate databases!

- **Development DB:** 5 Sofia restaurants ‚úÖ (ep-shiny-frog)
- **Production DB:** 0 restaurants ‚ùå (ep-fragrant-glade) 
- **SQL Access:** Works on development DB only
- **Deployment Issue:** Code updates but uses different database instance

### Technical Analysis
1. **Different Neon instances:** ep-shiny-frog vs ep-fragrant-glade
2. **Separate schemas:** Development has extended schema with isFullyVegan, hasVeganOptions
3. **Production isolation:** Production database is completely separate environment
4. **API mismatch:** Production API can't access development database data

### Resolution Strategy
Production needs its own data loading mechanism since:
- SQL tool only accesses development database
- Production uses different DATABASE_URL environment
- Deployment updates code but not database connection

### Next Steps
1. Wait for deployment to complete with new endpoints
2. Use production API endpoints to load data
3. Verify production database gets populated through application layer
