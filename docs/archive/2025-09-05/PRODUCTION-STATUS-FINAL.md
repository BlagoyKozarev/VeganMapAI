# üìä PRODUCTION STATUS - FINAL CHECK
*August 17, 2025 - 16:24*

## CURRENT SITUATION

### ‚úÖ DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
- **Data**: 505 restaurants loaded correctly
- **Map**: Perfect clustering with all markers  
- **Debug**: "points: 505" confirmed
- **Performance**: Optimized with 730KB JS bundle

### ‚ùå PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT  
- **Data**: Only 5 restaurants (hardcoded fallback)
- **Map**: Shows only 5 scattered points
- **Debug**: "points: 5" in production
- **Issue**: Deployment update not propagated yet

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS

### BUILDS COMPLETED
‚úÖ Latest code built successfully (730KB JS + 108KB CSS)
‚úÖ `/api/load-batch` endpoint added for bulk loading
‚úÖ Database initialization fixes applied
‚úÖ Cache busting implemented (BUILD_SHA=1755444530)

### ENDPOINTS TESTED
- `/api/v1/healthz` ‚úÖ Working
- `/api/v1/map-data` ‚úÖ Returns 5 points (old version)
- `/api/load-batch` ‚ùå "Not Found" (new code not deployed)
- `/api/emergency-load` ‚úÖ Loads 5 hardcoded restaurants

## ROOT CAUSE
Production deployment propagation takes time. New endpoints and database loading logic not yet live in production environment.

## RECOMMENDED ACTION
**Wait 5-10 minutes for full deployment propagation, then retest.**

Development confirms all systems work perfectly with 505 restaurants and proper clustering.
