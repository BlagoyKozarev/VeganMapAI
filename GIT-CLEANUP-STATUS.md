# Git Cleanup Status Report

## ✅ Completed Successfully

### 🧹 File Cleanup
- **Removed**: All `attached_assets/` directory (thousands of sensitive files)
- **Removed**: JSON files containing GCP service account keys
- **Removed**: GitHub tokens from shell scripts
- **Added**: Comprehensive `.gitignore` for future protection

### 🔧 Tools Setup
- **git-filter-repo**: Successfully installed and executed
- **Security hooks**: Pre-push hooks created for future protection
- **Cleanup scripts**: Multiple cleanup scripts prepared

### 📁 Repository State
- **Files removed**: Thousands of sensitive files untracked
- **History**: Partially cleaned with git-filter-repo
- **Working tree**: Clean state maintained
- **Core project**: All VeganMapAI code preserved

## ❌ Still Pending

### 🔒 Git Authentication
- **Issue**: Git operations blocked by Replit git protection
- **Status**: `index.lock` prevents automated operations
- **Solution**: Manual Shell operations required

### 🚀 Push to GitHub
- **Branch**: Clean branch needs to be created and pushed
- **Authentication**: Token configured but not applied due to locks
- **Target**: Push cleaned repository to GitHub

## 🛠️ Manual Completion Steps

Execute these commands in **Shell tab**:

```bash
# 1. Wait for any background processes and clear locks
sleep 10
find .git -name "*.lock" -delete

# 2. Check git status
git status

# 3. If clean, set up remote with token
git remote set-url origin https://$GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN@github.com/BlagoyKozarev/VeganMapAI.git

# 4. Create and push clean branch
CLEAN_BRANCH="clean/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"
git branch $CLEAN_BRANCH
git push -u origin $CLEAN_BRANCH --force

# 5. Create Pull Request on GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/BlagoyKozarev/VeganMapAI
# Create PR: clean/YYYYMMDD-HHMM → main
```
