# VeganMapAI Production Deployment Status

## Current Status (August 16, 2025)

### ✅ Production Site LIVE
- **URL:** https://vegan-map-ai-bkozarev.replit.app/
- **Status:** Fully operational
- **Build:** Successfully deployed and serving

### ❌ Critical Issue: Empty Database
- **Production database:** 0 restaurants
- **Development database:** 5 restaurants  
- **Root cause:** Production uses different Neon database (ep-fragrant-glade vs ep-shiny-frog)

### 🔧 Solution Implemented
- Created `/api/load-sample-data` endpoint for production database initialization
- Added 5 Sofia restaurants with vegan scores (8.0, 7.8, 7.4, 7.1, 6.8)
- Endpoint includes both GET and POST methods for flexibility

### 📊 Database Details
**Development DB (working):**
- 5 restaurants loaded
- Top venues: Loving Hut Sofia (8.0), Soul Kitchen (7.8), Edgy Veggy (7.4)
- All with proper coordinates and vegan scoring

**Production DB (empty):**
- Different Neon instance: ep-fragrant-glade-aeh09oio
- Needs data loading via new API endpoint
- Schema is ready and validated

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Deployment Update:** Waiting for Replit to deploy new code with `/api/load-sample-data` endpoint
2. **Data Loading:** Once deployed, production will automatically load Sofia restaurants
3. **Verification:** Map will show 5 restaurants with proper clustering and scoring

### 🎯 Expected Result
After deployment completes:
- Production map will display 5 Sofia restaurants
- Color-coded clustering (green/orange/red) will work
- Restaurant details with vegan scores will be available
- All features (search, filtering, AI assistant) will be functional

### 📍 Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** React + Vite with Leaflet maps
- **Backend:** Express + TypeScript with PostgreSQL
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL with 5 Sofia restaurants
- **Deployment:** Replit Deployments (automatic)
