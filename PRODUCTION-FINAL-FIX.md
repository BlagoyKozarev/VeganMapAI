# ðŸ”§ PRODUCTION FINAL FIX
*August 17, 2025 - 16:16*

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### PROBLEM
- Production database has only 5 restaurants 
- Development has 505 restaurants working perfectly
- Need batch loading endpoint for production data

### FIX ADDED
âœ… New `/api/load-batch` endpoint for production data loading
âœ… Build ready with new endpoint
âœ… Script ready to load all 505 restaurants in batches

### DEPLOYMENT PLAN
1. Deploy new code with batch endpoint
2. Run batch loading script to populate 505 restaurants
3. Verify production shows 505 points

### AFTER REDEPLOY
Production will have the batch endpoint and we can load all 505 restaurants automatically.
