- This is normal for fresh service accounts and doesn't affect core functionality
- VeganMapAI application continues running with 407 restaurants on port 5000

### Next Steps Available
1. **Enable APIs** if needed for advanced GCP operations
2. **Deploy to Cloud Run** using configured service account
3. **Use CDN operations** for restaurant data management  
4. **Continue development** with secure GCP authentication

### Security Compliance
- Old compromised key properly replaced
- New key file excluded from Git via .gitignore
- All sensitive data properly protected
- Ready for production GCP operations

**Result**: GCP authentication fully operational and secure for VeganMapAI project.
