# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT ISSUE
*August 17, 2025 - 16:04*

## PROBLEM
Deployment started but production still returns 5 points instead of 505.

## STATUS
- **Development**: ✅ 505 restaurants working perfectly
- **Production**: ❌ 5 restaurants (old deployment)
- **Health**: OK but old data
- **Frontend**: Shows "points: 5" on map

## POSSIBLE CAUSES
1. Deployment didn't complete successfully
2. Production database not synced
3. Caching issue preventing updates
4. Different environment variables

## ACTIONS TAKEN
- Triggered emergency-load endpoint to force database refresh
- Verified development environment works with 505 points
- Confirmed build artifacts are ready (730KB JS bundle)

## NEXT STEPS
1. Check if emergency-load helped
2. Verify production database status
3. May need to redeploy or check deployment logs
