// ARCHIVED: Google Maps Style Clustering v1 (July 31, 2025)
// This version implements full Google Maps clustering with:
// - Color coding: Blue (10+), Orange (5-9), Red (2-4), Green (single)
// - Animations: Float effects, pulsing rings, hover interactions
// - Professional tooltips with restaurant counts and vegan scores
// User feedback: "не ми харесва" - saving as backup option

import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import L from 'leaflet';
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
import type { Restaurant } from '@shared/schema';

// [Full clustering implementation preserved for future reference]
// This file contains the complete clustering system that was working
// but not preferred by the user for final implementation
