# DEPLOYMENT MONITORING
*Live tracking deployment progress*

## Status Checks

### Pre-deployment baseline
- Health: Working 
- Map data: 5 points (old version)

### During deployment (16:00)
- Health endpoint: Active with new timestamps
- Map data: Still returning 5 points (old version)
- Frontend: Shows "points: 5" on debug bar
- Status: Deployment in progress, not completed yet

### Post-deployment verification
*Waiting for deployment to complete...*

Expected results:
- Map data endpoint should return 505 points
- Assets should serve new JavaScript bundle
- Frontend should show "points: 505" on debug bar
